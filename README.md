This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented
a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more
performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
yarn
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
yarn build
```
